.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "July 20, 2017" v1.0
.SH NAME
.BR "hsh" " - simple shell program"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR hsh " ["
.IR "command_name" " [" "argument" " " "..." " ]]"
.PP
.BR hsh " ["
.IR "command_file" " ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple shell program, designed to emulate the basic functionality of
.BR dash .
As a command interpreter it is capable of executing external programs either
using the
.I " `PATH`"
environment variable or using an absolute path, supplied by the user. It can
be invoked in interactive mode by executing
.B hsh
directly. In this case, commands can be entered on the command line and will
be executed after pressing `return`. In all cases, the arguments to the command
will be parsed and fed to
.B execve()
after the full path of the executable is determined.
.PP
.B hsh
can also be used non-interactively by piping the standard output from a shell
that has implemented pipes to the standard input of
.BR hsh .
.PP
In addition,
.B hsh
can be used to execute simple scripts with no more than a single command per
line ending with a newline character. When executing scripts in the current
directory it is not necessary to have the current directory set in the
.RI ` PATH "`."
variable. However, for binary executables they must be invoked with the full
path or have their root directory listed in
.RI ` PATH "`."
.PP
If
.B hsh
detects an error or fails to fork a new process an error message will be printed
to
.IR stderr.
Error messages may also be generated directly by child processes or failures of
internal functions, such as calls to
.B malloc().
.SH BUILTINS
Currenty the only builtin functions that have been implemented are
.IR "exit" " and " "env" "."
.PP
.RS
.IR env -
entering
.I env
on the command line, or in a command file will print a list of all currently set
environment variables.
.PP
.IR exit -
this builtin function will cause the shell program to terminate.
.I exit
can also take an argument, which is the status code with which it should exit.
This status code can be retrieved by the calling process.
