## Holberton Simple Shell project
## Requirements
* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* C programs and functions will be compiled with ```gcc 4.8.4``` using the flags ```-Wall``` ```-Werror``` ```-Wextra``` and ```-pedantic```
* All your files should end with a new line
* Code should use the ```Betty``` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Header files should be include guarded
## Output
* Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as ```sh``` (```/bin/sh```) as well as the exact same error output.
* The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your ```argv[0]```
